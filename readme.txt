First steps toward a user based DRM
Ideas based upon the Transparency Hackathon in Geneva organized by Jean-Henry Morin
Implementation by Jörn Erbguth, joern@erbguth.net

Based upon release 0.7.10 of AlethZero - see QuickStartTransparencyHackathon.pdf

The current status shows how to register files (e.g. images on a blockchain). It also includes a draft architecture for a complete system.

The serpent-code has to be pasted into the data window of Alethzero.
The resulting contract id has to be entered at the top of the file drm.js
Then the drm.html can be called via a file-URL in the main window in the middle of Alethzero.
Make sure you have already mined some gas.

The files can be selected via an input field or via the drop zone.
Registration will be done via the "register" buttons.
